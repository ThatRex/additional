# Additional

An out of the way bot with additional commands and a patch for Discord. Created for my private Discord server.

## Commands: General

> **/ping**  
> Check if I am alive

## Commands: Voice

Members with move member perms can bulk move and set voice channel region.

> **/move \<voice-channel\>**  
> Move everyone to another voice channel  
> _Move Members_

> **/region get**  
> Get voice channel region

> **/region set \<region\>**  
> Set voice channel region  
> _Move Members_

## Commands: Notification

Notification roles can be created by prefixing a role names with `!!` like `!!chill`. The **/notify** command may be used by member with a role named `@notifier`.

> **/notify \<role\> [message]**  
> Notify subscribed server members  
> _@notifier, Mention Everyone_

> **/subscribe \<role\>**  
> Subscribe to notifications

> **/unsubscribe \<role\>**  
> Unsubscribe to notifications

## Patch: Voice Channel Chat

This bot grants members who enter a voice channel without sufficient permissions access to the text chat without viewing message history. This is achieved by adding channel permission overrides when users join the voice channel, then removing them when they leave.
